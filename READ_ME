HOW TO SETUP
Considering you already have conda installed you simply need to
"conda create -n ADL --file ADL_env_requirements.txt"
This will create a conda env "ADL" by the "ADL_evrequirements.txt" file
Always double check that nothing has been modified in the requirements.
This will be the case if anybody adds further packages to the conda env
But needs to be manually updated by
"conda list -e > ADL_env_requirements.txt"
Which will update the requirements with the one in your env.
Always double check you're in the right environment 

To launch the jupyter notebook make sure you're inside the env and use
"jupyter-notebook &"
This should open a web browser.
Once you made changes that you're happy with save them in git and push them,
Before pushing always pull to verify your changes will not collide with someone else
